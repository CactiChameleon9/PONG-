# Why?
I was too tired to do some actual work, so I made this one evening instead

# Would I recommend you play this version of PONG!?
In short, you decide. Here are the "features":
- It has quite slow acceleration on the paddle which can make things interesting (imagine on ice)
- I think the UI is alright
- The AI is very very very basic, but has better acceleration to help accommodate
- No multiplayer, menus, difficulty, or way to win - the game is endless

# Controls
- Left/Up == Paddle Up
- Right/Down == Paddle Down
- Gamepad/Keyboard supported
